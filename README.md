# General README for C++ Projects

This document provides an overview and setup instructions for three distinct C++ projects: CustPorts, PolyClass, and MatrixMath. Each project is designed with specific functionalities in mind, ranging from customer portfolio management to polynomial and matrix operations.

## Projects Overview

### CustPorts

CustPorts is a customer portfolio management system, enabling efficient tracking and analysis of customer portfolios, including stocks and bonds. It supports data persistence, portfolio projection, and various portfolio operations.

### PolyClass

PolyClass offers functionalities for performing arithmetic operations on polynomials, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, as well as differentiation and integration. It supports polynomial evaluation for given values and uses operator overloading for intuitive syntax.

### MatrixMath

MatrixMath is designed for matrix manipulation, providing operations such as matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, transposition, and equality testing. It supports matrices of various data types through C++ templates, facilitating complex mathematical computations and analyses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GNU g++ compiler or any C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming and terminal/command line usage.

### Compilation

Each project includes a Makefile for easy compilation. To compile any of the projects, navigate to the respective project directory and run:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the source code and generate an executable for the project.


## Testing

Each project includes test scripts or instructions for validating its functionalities. To run these tests, follow the guidelines provided in the project's README or test scripts.


## License

These projects are open-source and available under the MIT License.
